/**
 * Control Flow
 * 
 * 0: (INTRO) Control flow is the technical term for specifyig the sequence in which a code executes.
 *      - Under normal circumstances code is run from the first to last line unless the computer 
 *        encounters a structer that changes the control flow such as a loop or conditional statement
 * 
 *    Example
 *      - if (isEmpty(field)) {
 *          promptUser()  
 *        } else {
 *          submit form
 *        }
 * 
 * 1. Statements
 *    The main statements in JavaScript that govern control flow are if statements, else if statements, else statements, and switch statements
 * 
 *      If Statements - If statements are used to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
 *          
 *          Example -       if (condition) {
 *                              code to be executed
 *                          }
 *                  
 * 
 *      Else If Statements - are used to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
 * 
 *          Example -       if (condition1) {
 *                              code to run if condition is true
 *                          } else if (condition2) {
 *                              code to run if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
 *                          } else {
 *                              code to run if condition1 and 2 are false
 *                          }
 * 
 * 
 *      Else Statements - Else statements are used to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
 * 
 *          Example -       if (condition) {
 *                              code to run if condition is true
 *                          } else {
 *                              code to run if condition is false
 *                          }
 * 
 * 
 *      Switch Statements - Switch statements are used to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
 *                          The switch expression is evaluated once and the value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
 *                          If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
                            If there is no match, the default code block is executed.

 * 
 *          Example -       switch (expression) {
 *                              case x:
 *                                  //code to run
 *                                  break;
 *                              case y:
 *                                  //code to run
 *                                  break;
 *                              default:
 *                                  //code to run
 *                          }
 *
