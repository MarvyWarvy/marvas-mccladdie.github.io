 * 
 * Data Types
 * 0. Javascript values are always of a certain Data Type, of which there are eight of.
 *  
 * 1. The eight Data Types in JavaScript are as follows:
 *      - String - The String type represents textual dta and is encoded as a sequence of 16-bit
 *                 unsigned interger values. Each element in the string occupies a position in the string
 * 
 *      - Number - The Number type is as it sounds. A number. JavaScript is capable of storing numbers
 *                 up to (253 â€“ 1)and down to -(253 - 1)
 * 
 *      - BigInt - The BigInt Data Type is a numeric primitive capable of representing integers with
 *                 an arbitrary magnitude
 * 
 *      - Boolean - Booleans represent a logical entity and is inhabited by two values: true and false
 * 
 *      - Undefined - The undefined type consists of only one value: undefined.
 *                    This datatype indicates the absence of a value
 * 
 *      - Null - This data type, again, houses only one value: null
 *                Whereas undefined represents the absence of a value, null represents the absence of an object
 * 
 *      - Symbol - Symbols are unique Data Types. They are immutable and primitive and may be used as the key
 *                 of an object property
 * 
 *      - Object - an Object is a value in memory which is possible referenced by an identifier. In JS, the only
 *                 mutable values are objects
 *                      --> The object Data Type can contain: An object, an array, a date      
 *                
 * 
 * 2. Examples
 *          //Numbers ---> let length = 16;
 *                         let weight = 7.5;
 * 
 *          //Strings ---> let color = "Yelllow";
 *                         let lastName = "Johnson";
 * 
 *          //Booleans --> let x = true;
 *                         let y = false;
 * 
 *          //Objects ---> let person = {firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe"};
 *              - //Array Object ---> let cars = ["Challenger", "N74", "Viper"]
 *              - //Date Object ----> let date = new Date("2022-02-01")
 * 
 *          //BigInts ---> let whale = BigInt(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER)
 * 
 *          //Undefined -> let x
 *                         console.log(x) //Will log undefined
 * 
 * 3. Important things to note
 *      - In Javascript, Data Types are dynamic
 *          - Example
 *              let x; //x is undefined
 *              x = 5; //now x is a number
 *              x = "John" //now x is a string
 *
