/**
 * 
 * 
 * Functions
 * 0. Functions are one fo the fundamental building blocks in Javascript. They are blocks of code
 *    designed to perform a particular task
 * 
 * 
 * Syntax
 * 1. Functions in Javascript are defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by 
 *    parentheses
 *
 *      a.) Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
 *      b.) The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas 
 *      c.) function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked
 *      d.) inside of the function, the arguments behave as local variables
 *
 * 
 *                  function doSomething(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
 *                          code to be executed
 *                  }
 *          
 *              //function invocation
 *                          doSomething(arg1, arg2, arg3)
 * 
 * 2. When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing. if the function was invoked
 *    from a statement, javascript will return to execute the code after the invoking statement. The return value
 *    is returned back to the caller
 *              
 *                  function myFunction(a, b) {
 *                      return a * b
 *                  }
 *      
 *                  let x = myFunction(4, 3);
 * 
 *   
 * Important Things to Note               
 * 3. So why functions?
 *      - functions are useful because they allow us to define the code once, and reuse it as many
 *        times as we like
 *
