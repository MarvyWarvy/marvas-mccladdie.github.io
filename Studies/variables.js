/**
 * VARIABLES
 * 
 * 0: (INTRO) Variables are named containers for data in JavaScript. 
 * We can declare variables with the var, let, or const keywords
 *  - There are two phases of using variables, declaration and initialization/asignment
 * 
 * 
 * 1: Declaration: 
 * To create a variable in JavaScript it must be declared with a declarative keyword
 *      - Var, let, const are different declarative keywords that do different things
 *          a.) Var declarations give a variable global scope and allow reassignment.
 *          b.) Let declarations give a variable block scope and allow reassignment.
 *          c.) Const declaration give a variable block scope and Do Not allow reassignment.
 * 
 * 2: Assignment: 
 * At the declaration phase a variable is undefined because it is not assigned to anything.
 *      
 *          (Example)
 *              var myName;
 *              console.log(myName); --> prints undefined
 * 
 *      - To give a variable assignment it must be set equal to something.
 *          
 *          (Example)
 *              var myName = "Marvas";
 *              console.log(myName); --> prints "Marvas"
 * 
 * 3: Re-assignment
 * Since the declarative words "Var" and "Let" allow re-assignment they can be updated to a new value.
 * 
 *          (Example)
 *              var myName = "Marvas";
 *              myName = "Marv"
 *              console.log(myName); --> Now the variable myName prints "Marv"
 *      
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *
